HOW WE OPERATE:

Altria’s companies are tobacco industry leaders and have been for thirty years. Through the years, we’ve also shown our leadership in how we approach topics facing our industry.  For example, we were the only major tobacco companies to support Food & Drug Administration regulation of tobacco products.  
We know our products aren’t for everyone, so our companies take steps designed to limit the reach of their brands and marketing materials to unintended audiences.  

HOW WE'RE CHANGING:

As consumer preferences and society’s views toward tobacco change, our companies are working to provide a wider variety of tobacco products for adults.  There’s growing evidence that suggests some tobacco products are less harmful than others.  So today, we’re working to develop and market tobacco products that could be less harmful for adult tobacco consumers and talking with the FDA about them.

WHAT WE VALUE:

Our employees are the reason why we continue to succeed and provide strong shareholder returns.  That’s why we invest in programs that build their capabilities and grow leadership skills.  We also support our employees as they contribute their time and talents to improve the communities where they live and work.

Customers have taken advantage of the fact that we’re the single largest liquidity pool for U.S. equities (in volume traded). We’re also acclaimed for our top-rated data offerings.

Now, more than 59 years later, the 74,000-plus team members at O’Reilly Auto Parts are proud of the company's achievements over the years. 

During our early years, we focused on sales and slow and steady growth. At the end of our first year, sales totaled $700,000, and by 1961 volume reached $1.3 million. For the first seven years of operation, there was one store in Springfield, MO, until the second opened in July 1964. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility was built in Springfield for the O’Reilly/Ozark warehouse operation. By that time, the company had nine stores, all located in southwest Missouri. 

The long range plans and stability of the company were solidified by a public offering of company stock in April 1993. Since that time, the Company has grown through new store and distribution center openings, as well as numerous mergers and acquisitions. O'Reilly currently operates stores in 45 states, including Alaska and Hawaii, and distribution centers in 27 locations.

Through 2002, the company operated as a typical supply cooperative.

In September 2006, the company established its new Corporate Vision and Corporate Values, identifying its long-term aspirations and driving values.

How about Kansas City? That’s our home. That’s where Garmin put a stake in the ground in 1989. We’ve grown substantially over the years, offering diverse products and global reach in 5 diverse markets. But some things won’t ever change: Our entrepreneurial spirit and a culture where everyone’s opinion matters. That’s because we believe it’s possible to light the tech world on fire and still be on a first name basis.

BIG IDEAS, SMALL EGOS
What we do best is make products that let our customers do what they love. To do that, we focus on practical innovation, never losing sight of the benefits our products bring to our customers. Sure, we love bells and whistles. What leading technology company doesn't? But we make sure ours have purpose. It’s not about the things we make. It’s about the things we make possible.

WE’RE GLOBAL, SERIOUSLY.
Yeah, we’re based in Kansas City, but we are truly a global company. With offices throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America and Australia, our products are sold all over the world. One elevator ride at our headquarters and you’re likely to hear 4 (or more) different languages being spoken. At Garmin, we may act local, but we think global.

DREAM BIG. SLEEP WELL.
At Garmin, we like to encourage dreamers. But at some point it’s nice to wake up and enjoy a fully aware life. So we make it super easy to achieve a good balance between working, dreaming and enjoying life—from workout classes offered throughout the day, breaks to get out and move on our campus, and wellness programs offered throughout the year. It’s almost impossible not to take advantage of Garmin’s work-life balance opportunities.",6982.0
